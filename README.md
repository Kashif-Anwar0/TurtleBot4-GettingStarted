## 1. Introduction

This guide provides the essential steps to set up your Turtlebot4 (Standard or Lite), perform initial checks (especially important for used hardware), connect it to your WiFi network, and verify basic ROS 2 operation, including gamepad teleoperation.

**Target Robot:** Turtlebot4 Standard or Turtlebot4 Lite
**Target ROS Distro:** ROS 2 Jazzy (using official Turtlebot4 Jazzy image)
**Target Audience:** Users setting up a Turtlebot4, potentially for the first time or with used hardware. Basic familiarity with Linux command line and ROS 2 concepts is helpful.

**Goal:** To safely power up the robot, configure WiFi, verify core ROS 2 functionality, and control the robot with a gamepad.

---

## 2. Safety First!

**WARNING:** While designed as a research and education platform, the Turtlebot4 is a mobile robot that can move unexpectedly if programmed incorrectly or if sensors malfunction.

*   **Clear Workspace:** Always ensure the robot's operating area is clear of obstacles, cables, fragile items, pets, and people, especially during initial testing and autonomous operation.
*   **Stable Surface:** Operate the robot on a flat, level surface. Avoid stairs or ledges.
*   **Emergency Stop:** Familiarize yourself with the user interface buttons on the top plate. While not a dedicated E-Stop like industrial robots, know how to quickly halt motion (often by stopping the teleop node or gently lifting the drive wheels off the ground if absolutely necessary and safe to do so). The Create 3 base also has buttons that might stop motion.
*   **Lifting:** Lift the robot carefully by its designated sturdy points (refer to Clearpath documentation) if needed. Avoid lifting by sensors or the Raspberry Pi.
*   **Power Off:** Power down the robot using the Create 3 power button before making hardware changes or performing maintenance.

## 3. Hardware Overview & Pre-Checks

### Components

*   **iRobot Create 3 Base:** Provides mobility, battery, power, and basic sensors (cliff, bump, IR).
*   **Raspberry Pi 4 Computer:** Runs the main ROS 2 software stack.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **LiDAR:** (Slamtec RPLIDAR A1 or similar) for mapping and navigation.
    *   **OAK-D Camera:** (Standard: OAK-D-Pro, Lite: OAK-D-Lite) provides depth, RGB vision, and IMU data.
*   **User Interface Plate:** Includes display screen, buttons, status LEDs.
*   **Power System:** Create 3 internal battery, charging dock.

### Physical Inspection (Essential for Used Bots)

*   **Overall Condition:** Check chassis, RPi, sensors for obvious physical damage (cracks, dents, bends).
*   **Wiring:** Look for loose wires, damaged insulation, strained connectors.
*   **LiDAR:** Ensure it's unobstructed and spins freely (gently try by hand if accessible, don't force).
*   **Camera:** Lenses clean and scratch-free? Securely mounted?
*   **RPi:** Securely mounted? SD card slot looks okay? Heat sink (if present) attached?
*   **Create 3:** Wheels/casters spin freely? Free of debris? Bumper moves correctly?

### Connections Check

*   **SD Card:** Ensure the flashed SD card is properly seated in the Raspberry Pi.
*   **Create 3 to RPi:** Verify the USB-C cable connecting the Create 3 base to the Raspberry Pi 4 is securely plugged into **both** devices. This is CRITICAL for communication.
*   **Power (RPi):** Ensure the power cable from the Create 3 circuitry/Turtlebot4 PCB to the Raspberry Pi's USB-C power input is secure.
*   **OAK-D Camera:** Check the USB cable connection to the Raspberry Pi.
*   **LiDAR/UI Plate:** Check the cable connecting the LiDAR and UI plate to the Raspberry Pi (often via a dedicated PCB on the Turtlebot4 top structure).

### Battery Charging

*   Ensure the Create 3 battery is installed and latched securely.
*   Place the Turtlebot4 on its charging dock. Ensure the dock is plugged in and the robot makes good contact.
*   Observe charging indicators on the Create 3 base. Allow it to charge significantly before proceeding, especially if the battery status is unknown.

## 4. Prerequisites

*   **Workstation:** A computer running Ubuntu 24.04 (recommended) with ROS 2 Jazzy installed.
*   **SD Card:** A reliable microSD card (16GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended, Class 10 / U1 / A1 or better).
*   **SD Card Reader/Writer:** For flashing the OS image.
*   **OS Image:** Download the correct Turtlebot4 Jazzy image (`turtlebot4-standard-jazzy-X.Y.Z.iso` or `turtlebot4-lite-jazzy-X.Y.Z.iso`) from Clearpath Robotics or official sources. Verify checksums if provided.
*   **Network Information:** Your WiFi network's SSID (name) and password.
*   **Gamepad (Optional but Recommended):** A compatible gamepad (e.g., Xbox, PS4/PS5) for teleoperation.

---

## 5. OS Installation (Flashing the SD Card)

1.  **Download Image:** Obtain the correct `.iso` file for your Turtlebot4 model (Standard/Lite) and ROS 2 Jazzy.
2.  **Install Flashing Tool:** Use a reliable flashing tool like [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
3.  **Flash the SD Card:**
    *   Insert the SD card into your reader connected to your workstation.
    *   Launch the flashing tool.
    *   Select the downloaded Turtlebot4 `.iso` image.
    *   Select the microSD card drive **(BE VERY CAREFUL TO SELECT THE CORRECT DRIVE)**.
    *   Start the flashing process. This will erase the SD card.
    *   Wait for flashing and verification to complete.
4.  **Eject Safely:** Eject the SD card from your workstation.
5.  **Insert into Robot:** Insert the flashed SD card into the Raspberry Pi 4 on the Turtlebot4.

## 6. Phase 0: Fixing Potential Netplan Permissions (If needed)

*Based on your previous experience, you might encounter Netplan permission warnings on first boot, potentially interfering with WiFi setup.*

**Perform these steps ONLY if you see Netplan permission warnings (like in your image) when the system boots OR if the WiFi configuration fails later.**

1.  **Boot & Connect:** Let the robot boot into AP Mode (Phase 1 below). Connect your workstation to the `Turtlebot4` WiFi and SSH in (`ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1`).
2.  **Check/Fix Permissions:**
    ```bash
    # Check current permissions (optional)
    ls -l /etc/netplan/

    # Fix permissions (run these commands)
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/40-ethernets.yaml
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/50-wifis.yaml

    # Verify permissions changed to -rw------- (optional)
    ls -l /etc/netplan/

    # Apply the configuration cleanly
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
3.  **Reboot (Recommended):** A reboot ensures the system starts fresh with correct permissions applied.
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```
4.  **Wait & Reconnect:** Wait for the robot to reboot (it should return to AP mode), reconnect your workstation to the `Turtlebot4` WiFi, and SSH back in before proceeding to Phase 2.

---

## 7. Phase 1: First Boot and Initial Network (AP Mode)

### Power On Sequence

1.  Ensure the flashed SD card is inserted.
2.  Press the power button on the iRobot Create 3 base. Wait for its startup sounds/lights.
3.  The Raspberry Pi should power on automatically. Observe the small display screen on the Turtlebot4 top plate.
4.  **Patience:** The very first boot after flashing can take **several minutes** (5+) as it expands the filesystem and initializes services.

### Expected AP Mode Behavior

*   The Turtlebot4 should default to **Access Point (AP) mode**.
*   The robot's display screen should eventually show:
    *   WiFi Mode: `AP`
    *   SSID: `Turtlebot4`
    *   IP: `10.42.0.1`
*   A WiFi network named `Turtlebot4` should become visible on your workstation.

### Connecting Your Workstation

*   On your workstation, find and connect to the `Turtlebot4` WiFi network.
*   Password: `Turtlebot4` (case-sensitive)

### Verify Basic Connectivity (SSH)

*   Open a terminal on your workstation.
*   **Ping the robot:**
    ```bash
    ping 10.42.0.1
    ```
    *   *Check:* You should get successful replies. If not, check workstation WiFi connection, robot screen status, or consider re-flashing.
*   **SSH into the robot:**
    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1
    ```
    *   Password: `turtlebot` (case-sensitive)
    *   *Check:* You should successfully log in to the robot's command line.

**STOP HERE IF PING OR SSH FAILS.** Do not proceed until you can reliably connect via SSH in AP mode. Re-flash the SD card, try a different SD card, or re-check hardware connections.

---

## 8. Phase 2: Configure WiFi (Switching to Client Mode)

**Goal:** Connect the Turtlebot4 to *your* existing WiFi network.

*Make sure you have completed Phase 0 (Netplan permissions) if you encountered those warnings.*

### Launch Setup Tool

*   While SSH'd into the robot (`ubuntu@10.42.0.1`):
    ```bash
    ros2 run turtlebot4_setup turtlebot4_setup
    ```
    *   *Troubleshooting:* If this command fails ("package not found", "executable not found", etc.), check the ROS environment (`echo $ROS_DISTRO` should be `jazzy`, `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` if needed) or suspect a bad OS flash -> Re-flash SD card.

### Navigate and Enter Credentials

*   Use `Arrow Keys` and `Enter` to navigate the text-based menu.
*   Select `[ Network Configuration ]`.
*   Select `[ Connect to an existing WiFi network (Client Mode) ]`.
*   **Enter SSID:** Type your WiFi network name **exactly** (case-sensitive).
*   **Enter Password:** Type your WiFi password **exactly** (case-sensitive). Double-check for typos.

### Save Settings & Monitor

*   Navigate to `[ Save Settings ]` and press `Enter`.
*   **Observe Carefully:**
    *   **Terminal:** Watch for success or error messages. Errors like `Could not activate connection` or `Failed to save` indicate problems.
    *   **Robot Screen:** The screen should update. It might briefly show errors or "Connecting..."
*   **Success:**
    *   Terminal shows success messages.
    *   Robot screen updates to show:
        *   WiFi Mode: `Client`
        *   SSID: `<Your_WiFi_SSID>`
        *   IP: `<New_IP_Address>` (e.g., 192.168.x.x assigned by your router)
    *   Your SSH session to `10.42.0.1` will **disconnect** as the robot changes networks. This is expected.
*   **Failure:**
    *   Terminal shows errors (e.g., activation failed).
    *   Robot screen might show `UNKNOWN` IP or revert to AP mode details, or get stuck.
    *   The `Turtlebot4` AP may or may not reappear.

### Troubleshooting WiFi Transition Failure

*   **Most Common:** Incorrect SSID or Password. Double, triple-check case sensitivity and special characters.
*   **Weak Signal:** Is the robot too far from your router?
*   **Router Issues:** MAC filtering? DHCP pool full? Needs reboot? 2.4GHz vs 5GHz compatibility (TB4 Pi 4 supports both, but check router settings)?
*   **Netplan Issues:** Did you fix permissions (Phase 0) if needed?
*   **What to Do:**
    1.  Power cycle the robot (Create 3 button off, wait 10s, on).
    2.  See if it boots back into AP mode (`10.42.0.1`). If yes, try configuration again carefully.
    3.  If it stays "UNKNOWN" or AP doesn't return, re-flash the SD card and start over, being meticulous with credentials. Consider testing credentials from another device near the robot.

## 9. Phase 3: Verification After Successful WiFi Connection

### Find the New IP Address

*   **Robot Screen:** Check the display for the IP address listed next to "Client".
*   **Router Admin Page:** Log in to your WiFi router and look for a connected device named "ubuntu" or "turtlebot4".
*   **Network Scan:** Use a tool on your workstation (connected to the *same* WiFi) like `nmap`: `nmap -sn <your_network_range>` (e.g., `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` - find your range).

### Reconnect Workstation and SSH

*   Ensure your workstation is connected to the **same WiFi network** as the robot.
*   SSH into the robot using its **new** IP address:
    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@<robot_new_ip_address>
    ```
    *   Password: `turtlebot`
    *   *Check:* Successful login confirms network connectivity in Client mode.

### Check ROS 2 Environment

*   Inside the new SSH session on the robot:
    ```bash
    # 1. Check running nodes (services start automatically)
    ros2 node list
    ```
    *   *Check:* Expect a list including `/create3_node`, `/lidar_node`, `/camera` (or similar), `/robot_state_publisher`, `/turtlebot4_node`, etc. An empty or very short list indicates a problem with ROS startup services (`systemctl status turtlebot4.service`).
    ```bash
    # 2. Check basic topics
    ros2 topic list # See available topics
    ros2 topic echo /odom --once # Check odometry from Create 3
    ros2 topic echo /scan --once # Check LiDAR data (may take a moment)
    ros2 topic echo /diagnostics --once # Check system status
    # For TB4 Standard: ros2 topic echo /color/image_raw --once (or /oakd/rgb/image_raw etc.)
    ```
    *   *Check:* You should see data being published. Errors or no data point to issues with specific hardware drivers or core ROS setup.

## 10. Phase 4: Gamepad Controller Setup (Teleoperation)

### Identify and Connect Controller

*   **Supported:** Xbox, PS4, PS5 controllers are commonly used. Generic Linux joysticks may work.
*   **USB:** Plug the controller directly into a free USB port on the Raspberry Pi 4.
*   **Bluetooth:** Proceed to the next step.

### Pair Bluetooth Controller (If applicable)

1.  SSH into the robot.
2.  Enter the Bluetooth command-line utility: `bluetoothctl`
3.  Inside `bluetoothctl`, type commands one by one:
    ```
    power on
    agent on
    default-agent
    scan on
    ```
4.  Put your controller in **pairing mode** (e.g., Hold Share+PS button on PS4/5; Hold sync button on Xbox).
5.  Watch the `bluetoothctl` scan output. Note the `Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` MAC address of your controller.
6.  Pair, trust, and connect (replace `XX:XX...` with your controller's MAC):
    ```
    pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    ```
7.  Once connected, turn scanning off and exit:
    ```
    scan off
    exit
    ```

### Verify Controller Detection

*   Whether USB or Bluetooth, check if the system created a joystick device:
    ```bash
    ls /dev/input/js*
    ```
    *   *Check:* You should see at least one device listed (e.g., `/dev/input/js0`) when the controller is connected and recognized. Test with `jstest-gtk` if needed (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install jstest-gtk`, then `jstest /dev/input/js0`).

### Install/Verify Teleop Packages

*   The Turtlebot4 image *should* include these, but verify:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ros-jazzy-teleop-twist-joy ros-jazzy-joy-linux
    ```

### Launch Teleop Node

*   The `joy_linux_node` (driver) usually starts automatically. You need to launch the node that translates joy messages to robot velocity commands.
*   Open **a new terminal on your workstation** (don't close the SSH session, or open a second SSH session). Source your ROS 2 setup (`source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` or your workspace).
*   Alternatively, run this **inside the SSH session** on the robot:
    ```bash
    # Determine your controller type (e.g., 'xbox', 'ps4', 'ps5')
    # Common config names: xbox, ps4, ps5 - check turtlebot4_teleop package if unsure
    ros2 launch turtlebot4_teleop joy_teleop.launch.py joy_config:=xbox # Or ps4, ps5, etc.
    ```
*   *Check:* The command should run without errors, indicating it's waiting for `/joy` messages.

### Test Control

1.  **SAFETY CHECK:** Ensure the robot is on the floor with ample clear space. Keep fingers away from wheels.
2.  **Dead Man's Switch:** Most configurations require holding a specific button (e.g., LB on Xbox, L1 on PS) to enable motion. Check the `turtlebot4_teleop` configuration or documentation if unsure.
3.  **Move Sticks:** While holding the enable button (if required), carefully move the joysticks assigned to linear (forward/backward) and angular (left/right) motion.
4.  *Check:* The robot should move! If not:
    *   Is the `joy_teleop.launch.py` process running without errors?
    *   Is the correct `joy_config` selected?
    *   Is the controller properly connected (`/dev/input/jsX` exists)?
    *   Are messages published on `/joy` when you press buttons? (`ros2 topic echo /joy --once` in another terminal/SSH)
    *   Are messages published on `/cmd_vel` when you move sticks (while holding enable button)? (`ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel --once`)
    *   Are there any errors on the Create 3 base (check `/diagnostics`)?

## 11. Next Steps

*   Explore Turtlebot4 Tutorials (Mapping, Navigation): Check Clearpath Robotics documentation and ROS Index.
*   Run RViz on your workstation for visualization (`ros2 launch turtlebot4_viz view_robot.launch.py`).
*   Learn about the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2).
*   Start writing your own ROS 2 nodes to interact with sensors and control the robot.
